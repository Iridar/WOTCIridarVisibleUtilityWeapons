[WOTC] Visible Utility Items

This small and purely visual mod will make grenades and other utility items visible at all times in the Armory, and, with some caveats, in Tactical.

Without this mod, the game displays only the first item in the utility slot, and only in Tactical.

With this mod, you'll be able to see all utility items, such Medikit and Skulljack, and up to five grenade-like items equipped on your soldiers. Grenade-like items include all items that are carried in the grenade visual slot, like Battle Scanner, Mimic Beacon, Ultrasonic Lure, etc.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
[list][*] Utility items are not be visible during Skyranger deployment cinematics and potentially in other situations.
[*] When you equip several identical items, such as several Smoke Grenades, they will correctly appear separately in the Armory, but in Tactical they will be all merged into one item. This may or may not be addressed in the future.
