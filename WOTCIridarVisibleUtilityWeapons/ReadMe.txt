[WOTC] Visible Utility Items

This small and purely visual mod will make grenades and other utility items visible at all times in the Armory, and, with some caveats, in Tactical.

Without this mod, the game displays only the first item in the utility slot, and only in Tactical.

With this mod, you'll be able to see all utility items, such as Medikit and Skulljack, and up to five grenade-like items equipped on your soldiers. Grenade-like items include all items that are carried in the grenade visual slot, like Battle Scanner, Mimic Beacon, Ultrasonic Lure, etc.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]
[list][*] Utility items are still not be visible during Skyranger deployment cinematics and potentially in other situations.
[*] When you equip several identical items, such as several Smoke Grenades, they will correctly appear separately in the Armory, but in Tactical they will be all merged into one item. There's not much that can be done about it.
[*] When you equip several different items that occupy the same visual slot on the soldier's body, such as Medikit and Overdrive Serum, their models will clip through each other.
[*] Depending on soldier cosmetics, visible utility items may clip through soldiers' equipment or float in the air.
[*] Abilities that grant extra item uses, such as Heavy Ordnance, will have no effect on the number of items you see.

Safe to add or remove mid-campaign.

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

In theory, the mod might have compatibility issues with mod-added items that occupy the visual grenade slot, but use new animations that are not specified in the weapon archetype. In that case the weapon model might remain on the soldier's belt even after it has been thrown. In other words, a minor visual glitch.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

Some aspects of this mod are configurable in:
[code]..\steamapps\workshop\content\268500\2849922249\Config\XComGame.ini[/code]

There are also several ways to exclude particular items from being affected by this mod.
